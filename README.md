# Dogs-Vs-Cats-Classification
It's an CNN model which analyze the photo and give the outcome.
In this model, I used 3 layers of CNN to determine the result.
It has a accuracy of more than 80 percent.
Outcome lies between 0 and 1.
Value near to zero indicates cat and value near to 1 indicates dog.
I used tensorflow,keras,matplotlib libraries.
For reducing overfitting, I used BatchNormalization and Dropout.
